Currently I'm just building the basics of the language with Rust, but I will probably eventually switch to GO or Nim if I feel like it(which would be wise to do at the start).

I have a lot of ideas for a programming language and what I build here is those ideas. The language will soon be inspired by Ruby, Node, and PHP (without the brackets lol).

I am going at this thinking like a web developer, so I think it would be fair to say this will be more user friendly to web devs, but I will also think about other use-cases like for desktop or whatever.
